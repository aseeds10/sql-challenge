# SQL Challenge
Challenge 9 - PostgreSQL

## Description
Prompt: I am the new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fi ctional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All thatremains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
<br>For this project, I design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, I perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis,respectively.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run scripts in PostgreSQL (seperate schemas for creating the tables and for the data anlysis).

## Acknowledgments
- Used Xpert Learning Assistant for assistance debugging.
